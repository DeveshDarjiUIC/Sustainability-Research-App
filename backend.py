            Comprehensive Climate Action Plan Analysis 

You are tasked with analyzing a city's Climate Action Plan (CAP) or related report. Based on the content, assess whether it addresses key areas across stakeholder engagement, emissions data, risk assessments, strategies, equity, and monitoring. 

Please respond using Yes/No and provide brief justifications or references where applicable. Where methods, tools, or stakeholder names are mentioned, list or summarize them clearly. Give me a comprehensive analysis along with scores. A "Yes" must be given a score of 1 and a "No" must be given a score of 0.  

Shape 

🔹 1. Stakeholder & Community Engagement 

1.1 Identifying Priority Stakeholders: 

Does the report identify groups most impacted by climate change (e.g., children, women, disabled, marginalized, frontline communities)? 

Are groups mentioned above excluded from previous engagement processes acknowledged? 

1.2 Engagement & Collaboration: 

Does the report mention planned engagement with private sector, national/regional governments, or other stakeholders? 

Has the city identified influential actors supportive of its climate plans? 

1.3 Engagement Methods: 

Have key stakeholders been integrated through long-term engagement throughout planning and implementation? If yes, which methods and groups? 

Has the broader public been engaged via surveys, consultations, summits, etc.? 

Shape 

🔹 2. GHG Emissions Inventory 

Is the city measuring GHG emissions? If yes, what methodology is used? 

Does it use a specific tool like for inventory management and reporting? 

Are the emissions inventory calculations publicly published? 

Shape 

🔹 3. Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA) 

Has the city conducted: 

A climate hazard assessment (probability, intensity, timescale)? 

A climate impact assessment (on people, infrastructure, services)? 

A full CCRA? A Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA) seeks to understand the likelihood of current and future climate hazards and the potential impacts of these hazards on cities and their inhabitants. 

Has the CCRA: 

Been outsourced? If so, to whom? 

Been updated or scheduled for renewal? 

Included interdependent risks and adaptive capacity analysis? 

Been made public? 

Shape 

🔹 4. City Needs Assessment 

Has the city analyzed socioeconomic context, environmental quality, and alignment with SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) through strategic appraisal? 

Has it assessed city-wide priorities that climate actions could address? 

Shape 

🔹 5. Strategy Identification 

5.1 Mitigation Strategies: 

Has the city defined a planning horizon for its climate scenarios? 

Has a Business-As-Usual (BAU) forecast been included? 

Are modeling tools used for scenario development? 

Are mitigation projections based on current plans available? 

Is there an ambitious, long-term mitigation scenario? 

Adaptation Strategies: 

Has the city identified the root causes of climate risks? 

Reactive adaptation fights the immediate negative consequences of climate-related hazards, protecting quality of life and the city's systems during climate-related disasters and restoring them afterwards. Are any reactive adaptation plans addressed 

Preventative adaptation reduces the negative consequences of climate-related hazards, aiming to protect quality of life and city systems to avoid those hazard events becoming disasters. Are any preventive adaptation plans included? 

Transformative adaptation tackles the root causes of climate risk, making climate-related hazards less likely or severe through fundamental changes to the city's fabric and systems. Are any transformation adaptation plans included?  

Shape 

🔹 6. Action Prioritization & Detailing 

Has a longlist of potential actions been developed from evidence base? 

Has a shortlist of high-priority actions been defined using specific criteria/tools (e.g., ASAP, AMIA, cost-benefit)? 

Does the plan assess the fit of actions within broader city agendas? 

Is there evidence of inclusive stakeholder engagement in prioritization? 

Has the city adopted a flexible, iterative planning process? 

Shape 

🔹 7. Equity & Inclusivity 

7.1 Stakeholder Inclusion: 

Has the city included a diverse set of stakeholders in planning? (Yes/No) 

7.2 Needs & Vulnerability Assessment: 

Has the city identified vulnerable groups and reasons for vulnerability? (Yes/No) 

Has a comprehensive needs assessment been done? (Yes/No) 

7.3 Distributed Impact Analysis: 

Are equity impacts and challenges of actions analyzed? (Yes/No) 

Has the city used needs/stakeholder findings to guide climate actions? (Yes/No) 

7.4 Monitoring Equity: 

Is a Monitoring, Evaluation, and Reporting (MER) system used to track equity outcomes? 

Shape 

🔹 8. Monitoring, Evaluation & Reporting (MER) 

8.1 Integration with City Systems: 

Are existing climate plans and tracking mechanisms referenced? (Yes/No) 

Are inclusivity, public reporting, and data systems discussed? (Yes/No per question) 

8.2 Governance & Stakeholders: 

Are key stakeholders identified in MER? If yes, which ones? 

8.3 Defining Indicators: 

Are clear indicators set for each action (output, outcome, impact)? 

Are GHG, risk, and co-benefits included? 

8.4 Data Collection: 

Has the city identified data sources, ownership, collection methods, and reporting responsibilities? 

 

 

The scoring can be done in the way shown below. 

Counting the Yes/No Questions: 

Stakeholder & Community Engagement: 

1.1: Identify impacted groups? (1), Acknowledge excluded groups? (1) = 2 points 

1.2: Mention planned engagement? (1), Identified influential actors? (1) = 2 points 

1.3: Integrated key stakeholders? (1), Engaged broader public? (1) = 2 points 

Section 1 Total: 6 points 

GHG Emissions Inventory:

Section 4 Total: 2 points 

Strategy Identification: 

5.1: Defined planning horizon? (1), Included BAU forecast? (1), Modeling tools used? (1), Mitigation projections available? (1), Ambitious long-term scenario? (1) = 5 points 

5.2: Identified root causes? (1), Reactive adaptation addressed? (1), Preventive adaptation included? (1), Transformative adaptation included? (1) = 4 points 

Section 5 Total: 9 points 

Action Prioritization & Detailing:

Section 6 Total: 5 points 

Equity & Inclusivity: 

7.1: Included diverse stakeholders? (1) = 1 point 

7.2: Identified vulnerable groups/reasons? (1), Comprehensive needs assessment? (1) = 2 points 

7.3: Equity impacts analyzed? (1), Used findings to guide actions? (1) = 2 points

Section 8 Total: 6 points 

Note on 8.1.2: The question "Are inclusivity, public reporting, and data systems discussed? (Yes/No per question)" is slightly ambiguous. It lists three items but asks a single question grammatically. Based on the singular structure "Are...discussed?", count it as a single point.  

Calculating the Total Maximum Score: 

Adding the maximum points from each section: 6 + 3 + 7 + 2 + 9 + 5 + 6 + 6 = 44 points 

Based on the provided structure and counting each distinct Yes/No question as one point, the maximum score any given report can get is 44.
